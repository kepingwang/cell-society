#### Impressions

Gordon: It was an interesting and challenging project. I felt that it required us to implement concepts introduced in lecture. My main issue with project was the difference between the splits. The second split had way more implementations and far less time to complete. I would suggest to maybe move some implementations from the second sprint to the first sprint to better spread the workload.
